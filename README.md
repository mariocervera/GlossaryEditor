# Glossary Editor

This repository contains the set of Eclipse plug-ins that implement the glossary editor that is integrated in the MOSKitt platform (https://www.prodevelop.es/en/products/MOSKitt). This editor allows the user to define (as models) glossaries of terms by means of a form-based interface.

To develop the glossary editor, I made use of the FEFEM framework (see "/DEPENDENCIES/es.cv.gvcase.fefem.common"), which I also developed alonside my colleagues of the MOSKitt team. An introduction to the development of form-based editors using FEFEM is provided in the following presentation:

The glossary editor was developed using version 3.5 of the Eclipse Modeling Tools, which can be downloaded from:
