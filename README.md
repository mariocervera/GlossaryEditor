# Glossary Editor

This repository contains a set of Eclipse plug-ins that implement a glossary editor. This editor allows the
user to define a glossary of terms by means of a form-based interface. To develop this editor, I used Java
and also model-driven Eclipse technologies such as EMF and JFace Databinding.
