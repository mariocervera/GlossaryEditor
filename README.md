# Glossary Editor

This repository contains a set of Eclipse plug-ins that implement a glossary editor. This editor allows the
user to define (as models) glossaries of terms by means of a form-based interface. To develop this editor, I used Java
and also model-driven Eclipse technologies such as the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and JFace Databinding.
